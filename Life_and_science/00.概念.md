**Ectopic expression** 异位表达 （上调和下调）is an abnormal gene expression in a cell type, tissue type, or developmental stage in which the gene is not usually expressed, or the protein of the gene is not functional.

**phosphorylation**磷酸化（蛋白质的） ATP, the "high-energy" exchange medium in the cell, is synthesized in the mitochondrion by addition of a third phosphate group to ADP in a process referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. 

**Proteasomes**蛋白酶体 are protein complexes inside all eukaryotes and archaea, and in some bacteria. Proteasomes is to degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds.

**F-box domain** is a protein structural motif of about 50 amino acids that mediates protein–protein interactions. I

**domains**结构上的 are a structural entity, usually meaning a part of the protein structure which folds and functions independently. So, proteins are often constructed from different combinations of these domains.

**motif**概念上的 in biology is a mathematical model, typically of a sequence, which is predictive of which sequences to some defined group

Alterations in the response of dark-grown seedlings to ethylene (the **"triple response"**) were used to isolate a collection of ethylene-related mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. ... Each of the "triple response" mutants has an effect on the shape of the seedling and on the production of the hormone.
