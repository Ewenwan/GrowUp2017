## Beyond Feelings

### 1Who are you

That **time and place** are defined by specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns. They would influence your responses.

When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably. In logic, this kinship is expressed by the term **sequitur**.

 **mass culture** (the broadcast media, newspapers, magazines, Internet and popular music).

Television programmers use frequent scene **shifts** and **sensory appeals** such as car crashes, violence, and sexual encounters to keep audience interest from diminishing.

“The consumer is to the manufacturer, the department stores and the advertising agencies, what the green frog is to the physiologist.”


**Self-transcendence**, the need to rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankl, “the primordial anthropological fact [is] that being human is being always directed, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love.” A person becomes fully human “by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.”

**Finding meaning**, according to Frankl’s theory, involves “perceiving a possibility embedded in reality” and searching for challenging tasks “whose completion might add meaning to [one’s] existence.”

**Becoming an Individual**In light of what we have discussed, we should regard individuality not as something we are born with but rather as something acquired—or, more precisely, **earned**. Individuality begins in the realization that it is impossible to escape being influenced by other people and by circumstance. **The essence of individuality is vigilance.** The following guidelines will help you achieve this:
1. Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative. No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until you have examined it.2. Decide why you reacted as you did. Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else—a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.3. Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or situation.4. Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction. And when you answer, resist the influence of your conditioning.
To ensure that you will really be an individual and not merely claimto be one, apply these guidelines throughout your work in this book, as well as in your everyday life.

### 2What Is Critical Thinking?
The late American philosopher William Barrett observed that “**history** is, fundamentally, the adventure of human consciousness” and “the fundamental history of humankind is the history of mind.”

**Feeling** is a subjective response that reflects emotion, sentiment, or desire; it generally occurs spontaneously.

**Thinking** is a conscious mental process performed to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding.

The focus of this book is on critical thinking. **The essence of critical thinking is evaluation.**

**Critical thinking**, therefore, may be defined as the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which have merit and which do not. In other words, critical thinking is a search for answers, a quest. Not surprisingly, one of the most important techniques used in critical thinking is asking probing questions. Where the uncritical accept their first thoughts and other people’s statements at face value, critical thinkers challenge all ideas.

**Intuition** is commonly defined as immediate perception or comprehension of something—that is, sensing or understanding something without the use of reasoning.


The basic activities in critical thinking are investigation, interpretation, and judgment, in that order:

>**Investigation**, finding evidence—that is, data that will answer key questions about the issue. The evidence must be both relevant and sufficient.
>
>**Interpretation**, deciding what the evidence means. The interpretation must be more reasonable than competing interpretations.
>
>**Judgment**, reaching a conclusion about the issue. The conclusion must meet the test of logic.

**Irresponsible thinkers** first choose their conclusions and then seek out evidence to justify their choices. The crucial thing is not to let hunches and hypotheses manipulate our thinking and dictate our conclusion in advance.

**Writing** may be used for either of two broad purposes: to discover ideas or to communicate them. **For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea seems to generate additional ideas.**
