## 1What makes for a dream job?

### Two overrated goals for a fulfilling career
People often imagine that a dream job is well paid and easy.

### Money makes you happier, but only a little
Finally, \$ **75,000** of household income is equivalent to an individual income of only \$ **40,000** if you don’t have kids.

To customize these thresholds for yourself, make the following adjustments:

1. Add **$20,000** per dependent who does not work that you fully support.
2. Add 50% if you live in an expensive city, or subtract 30% if you live somewhere cheap.
3. Add more if you’re especially motivated by money (or subtract some if you have frugal tastes).
4. Add 15% in order to be able to save for retirement (or however much you personally need to save in order to be able to maintain the standard of living described above).

The average college graduate in the United States earns \$**68,000** per year over his or her life, while the average Ivy League graduate earns over \$**100,000**. The upshot is that if you’re a college graduate in the US (or a similar country), you’ll likely end up well into the range where more income has almost no effect on your happiness. 


### Don’t aim for low stress

One puzzle is that studies of high-ranking government and military leaders found they had **lower** levels of stress hormones and less anxiety, despite sleeping fewer hours, managing more people and having greater demands placed on them.

One widely supported explanation is that **having a greater sense of control** – by setting their own schedules and determining how to tackle the challenges they face – protects them against the demands of the position.

Instead of seeking to avoid stress, seek out a supportive context and meaningful work, and then challenge yourself.
